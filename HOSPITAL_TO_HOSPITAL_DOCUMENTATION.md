# Hospital-to-Hospital Blood Request System

## Overview

The Hospital-to-Hospital Blood Request System enables hospitals to collaborate and support each other during emergency situations when they need blood units for their patients. This system implements the user story: **"As a hospital, I want to respond to blood requests from hospitals to support the patients when needed."**

## Features

### üè• Cross-Hospital Collaboration

- **Emergency Blood Requests**: Hospitals can create urgent blood requests for their patients
- **Response System**: Other hospitals can view and respond to blood requests with offers
- **Real-time Communication**: Hospitals can exchange notes and coordinate blood transfers
- **Urgency Management**: Requests are prioritized by urgency level (low, normal, high, critical)

### ‚è∞ Time-Sensitive Processing

- **Automatic Expiry**: Requests automatically expire based on urgency level
  - Critical: 4 hours
  - High: 8 hours
  - Normal/Low: 24 hours
- **Priority Ordering**: Requests sorted by urgency and creation time
- **Active Filtering**: Only shows non-expired, pending requests

### ü©∏ Blood Type Management

- **Compatibility Aware**: Supports all blood types (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-)
- **Unit Tracking**: Specify exact number of blood units needed
- **Partial Fulfillment**: Support for partial responses when full units not available

### üìä Request Lifecycle

- **Status Tracking**: pending ‚Üí partially_fulfilled ‚Üí fulfilled/cancelled/expired
- **Response Management**: offered ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí delivered
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of requests and responses

## Workflow

### Standard Emergency Request

1. **Request Creation**: Hospital creates urgent blood request for patient
2. **System Distribution**: Request appears in other hospitals' available requests
3. **Response Evaluation**: Other hospitals review and decide to respond
4. **Offer Submission**: Responding hospital offers available blood units
5. **Coordination**: Hospitals coordinate pickup/delivery details
6. **Fulfillment**: Request marked as fulfilled when blood received

### Request Lifecycle

```
Patient Emergency ‚Üí Create Request ‚Üí System Distribution ‚Üí Hospital Response ‚Üí Coordination ‚Üí Blood Transfer ‚Üí Request Fulfilled
```

### Priority Handling

- **Critical Requests**: 4-hour expiry, top priority display
- **High Priority**: 8-hour expiry, immediate attention required
- **Normal Requests**: 24-hour expiry, standard processing
- **Automatic Expiry**: System automatically expires old requests

## Security & Authentication

### Hospital Authentication Required

All endpoints require valid hospital authentication:

- Session-based authentication via `hospitalAuth` middleware
- Hospital-specific data access (hospitals can't respond to their own requests)
- Secure request and response tracking

### Data Protection

- Patient information protected and hospital-specific
- Request ownership validation
- Response authorization checks
- Audit trail through timestamps

## Usage Examples

### Create Emergency Blood Request

```javascript
const requestData = {
  patient_name: "Emergency Patient",
  blood_type: "O-",
  units_needed: 3,
  urgency_level: "critical",
  medical_condition: "Multi-trauma patient requiring immediate surgery",
  contact_details: "Dr. Emergency - ext. 911",
};

const response = await fetch("/api/hospital/requests", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: "include",
  body: JSON.stringify(requestData),
});
```

### Respond to Blood Request

```javascript
const responseData = {
  response_status: "offered",
  units_offered: 2,
  response_notes: "Available immediately, can deliver within 30 minutes",
  estimated_delivery_time: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(),
};

const response = await fetch(`/api/hospital/requests/${requestId}/respond`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: "include",
  body: JSON.stringify(responseData),
});
```
