echo "Since session cookies are blocked by browser security policies,"
echo "we'll implement JWT tokens which work reliably across domains."

# First, let's install jsonwebtoken in the backend
echo "1. Installing JWT dependencies..."

cd backend
npm install jsonwebtoken
cd ..

echo "âœ… JWT package installed"

echo "2. JWT Authentication will provide:"
echo "   - Login returns a JWT token"
echo "   - Frontend stores token in localStorage"
echo "   - Token sent in Authorization header"
echo "   - No dependency on cross-domain cookies"
echo ""

echo "3. Next steps:"
echo "   - Update hospital login to return JWT token"
echo "   - Create JWT middleware for authentication"
echo "   - Update frontend to use JWT tokens"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan:"
echo "======================"
echo ""
echo "Backend Changes:"
echo "- hospitalAuthController.js: Return JWT on login"
echo "- New jwtAuth.js middleware"
echo "- Update hospital routes to use JWT auth"
echo ""
echo "Frontend Changes:"
echo "- Store JWT token on login"
echo "- Send Authorization header with requests"
echo "- Handle token expiration"

echo "ðŸš€ This will solve the cross-domain session issue permanently!"
