## Database Schema

### Enhanced blood_requests Table

```sql
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name (Patient name)
- email (Contact email)

```

### Indexes for Performance

- `idx_blood_requests_status` - For status filtering
- `idx_blood_requests_blood_type` - For blood type filtering
- `idx_blood_requests_urgency` - For urgency filtering
- `idx_blood_requests_assigned_hospital` - For hospital assignment queries
- `idx_blood_requests_created_at` - For date-based queries

## Security & Authentication

### Hospital Authentication Required

All blood request management endpoints require valid hospital authentication:

- Session-based authentication
- Hospital-specific data access
- Role-based permissions

### Data Protection

- Hospital assignment tracking
- Audit trail through updated_at timestamps

## Usage Examples

### View Pending Urgent Requests

1. Navigate to Blood Requests page
2. Set Status filter to "Pending"
3. Set Urgency filter to "Urgent"
4. Review critical requests requiring immediate attention

### Approve a Blood Request

1. Click the "View Details" icon for a request
2. Review patient information and requirements
3. Click "Approve Request" button
4. Add optional notes for the approval
5. Request status updates to "Approved"

### Track Request Progress

1. Use status filters to view requests at different stages
2. Monitor fulfilled requests for completion tracking
3. Review declined requests with reasoning notes

## Integration Points
